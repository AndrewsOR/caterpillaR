# caterpillaR
For the upcoming Career Day at my children's school.  

Because children are the future, and if we don't teach them well, they'll get stuck on `dplyr` or *(shudder)* `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

These scripts use a well-known children's story to illustrate data science tasks: 

- Getting data: Use `data.table` to read raw text data (`food.txt`) into a wide data set
- Transforming datasets: Uses `data.table` to melt data to long 
- Summarizing data: Uses `data.table` to count by group
- Visualization: Uses `ggplot2` to plot food eaten per day (coming soon)
- Modeling: Build models to predict *how many items* the caterpillar will eat (regression) and *what kind of items* (classification) (coming soon)
